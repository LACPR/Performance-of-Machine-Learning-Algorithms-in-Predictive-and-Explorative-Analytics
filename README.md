# Predictive-Analytics-for-Readmission-of-Diabetic-Patients

Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms used in Predictive Analytics of Readmission of Diabetic Patients.

To analyze the performance of classification machine learning algorithms, a dataset from The University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository was selected. The original dataset contains the details about the factors related to hospital readmission of diabetic patients. These records contain information about various laboratory tests & procedures, diagnosis & medications that were administered in the duration of the hospital stay. The medical record of each patient included 50 potential risk factors & a label indicating whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days, after 30 days or was never readmitted.

Initially, 22 features were selected for the classification, but all algorithms led to poor performance. Finally, only 10 significant features were selected for the final analysis.

Apriori algorithm was used for association rule learning. 
K-means clustering was used for clustering data.
